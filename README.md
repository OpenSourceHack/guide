# The Definitive Guide to Open Source Hack 2016

## Where and When
Please arrive to **GitHub HQ, 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107**
at **10AM**. The event will be held on the 1st floor, check in to receive your
name tag. You will get a **blue** tag if you applied as a beginner or intermediate
hacker, and a **red** tag if you applied as an expert! Write your name and skills
on your badge - it will be helpful during the team building session! ðŸŽ‰

## Team Building
Team building will happen straight after the opening talks - **between 11 and 12
AM on Saturday**!

If you're an __expert__ (experienced hacker), youÂ will be pairing with beginner and intermediate hackers to form teams of up to 5. If you're a __beginner__ or intermediate hacker, you'll be selecting a group led by an expert to work on a project together.

For seasoned hackers, learning how to mentor is a fun way to share your skills while bringing to life a project you're excited to work on. For beginners, working on a team with people who've done this before is a great opportunity to learn andÂ removes a lot of friction in getting started.

#### How it's going to work:
After the opening talks, all the experts will line up and each give a quick introduction: their name, their skill set, and what they might be looking to work on.

#### Experts

Experts, be ready to give a 15-second intro on your skill set and talk about what you're looking to work on.
__Note:__ You don't have to come in committed to an idea; you can talk about an area of interest if you'd prefer.
