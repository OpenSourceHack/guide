# The Definitive Guide to Open Source Hack 2016

## Where and When
Please arrive to **GitHub HQ, 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107**
at **10AM**. The event will be held on the 1st floor, check in to receive your
name tag. You will get a **blue** tag if you applied as a beginner or intermediate
hacker, and a **red** tag if you applied as an expert! Write your name and skills
on your badge - it will be helpful during the team building session! ðŸŽ‰

## Team Building
Team building will happen straight after the opening talks - **between 11 and 12
AM on Saturday**!

If you're an __expert__ (experienced hacker), youÂ will be pairing with beginner and intermediate hackers to form teams of up to 5. If you're a __beginner__ or intermediate hacker, you'll be selecting a group led by an expert to work on a project together.

For seasoned hackers, learning how to mentor is a fun way to share your skills while bringing to life a project you're excited to work on. For beginners, working on a team with people who've done this before is a great opportunity to learn andÂ removes a lot of friction in getting started.

#### How it's going to work:
After the opening talks, all the experts will line up and each give a quick introduction: their name, their skill set, and what they might be looking to work on.

#### Experts

Experts, be ready to give a 15-second intro on your skill set and talk about what you're looking to work on.
__Note:__ You don't have to come in committed to an idea; you can talk about an area of interest if you'd prefer.

## How to Pitch Your Project
How do you explain what you've built? The impact of what you do is infinitely larger if you can get others excited about it too. This workshop will teach you how to present the amazing project you've been working on the last 24 hours.
